Collection of my repos as submodules

I plan to add each repo I've created in GitHub as submodules here as an easy way to clone all of them at once.

Using these commands should clone this repo and then fetch all the other repos as submodules:


```
  git clone https://github.com/JohnRyland/Repos.git
  git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Here is a list of the repos:

  - Backups
  - Compression
  - DataStructures
  - Maths3D
  - VimSettings
